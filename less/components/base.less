// GUIDE:
// Base rules are the defaults. They are almost exclusively single element selectors but it could include attribute selectors, pseudo-class selectors, child selectors or sibling selectors. Essentially, a base style says that wherever this element is on the page, it should look like this. (http://smacss.com/book/categorizing)

body{
	font-size: 62.5%;
	line-height: @baseLineHeight;
}

a{
	&:hover{}
}
